        <p>The Secretary of State is in the midst of a four-month modernization project to image and make available online historic business registration documents that pre-date the more recent records now available online. Some of these historic documents date to the 1830's. If you have research requests for historic records that pre-date 2000 and that are not already online, please understand that this modernization effort may result in research delays of up to a week or more.</p>
